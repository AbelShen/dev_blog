description: my first post and the reason I create this blog 
---

In a project I joined in one year ago, I learned ReactJS and am very glad to have it in my full stack development skill arsenal. As a developer who owns ReactJS skill and wants to open a blog. It's obviously an easy decision for me to learn and use GatsbyJS. 

By the same time the idea of being able to express my thoughts clearly by English writing is always amazing to me. It's not a problem for me when I write in Chinese so I know how good I will feel if I can do that. The only way I think I can improve my English writing skill is to practice. writing a technology blog sounds like a good plan. 

Every day I meet all kinds of problems from my consultant job and try my best to solve them. The result of the solutions is very valuable, however, the tools, processes, strategy and retrospective thoughts still have two cents. I would love to find a place to record and share them.

So as a developer, Hello world!
